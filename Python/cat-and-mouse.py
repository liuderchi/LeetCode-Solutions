# A game on an undirected graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.
#
# The graph is given as follows: graph[a] is a list of all nodes b such that ab is an edge of the graph.
#
# Mouse starts at node 1 and goes first, Cat starts at node 2 and goes second, and there is a Hole at node 0.
#
# During each player's turn, they must travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are.
# For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it must travel to any node in graph[1].
#
# Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)
#
# Then, the game can end in 3 ways:
#
# If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.
# If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.
# If ever a position is repeated
# (ie. the players are in the same position as a previous turn,
# and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.
# Given a graph, and assuming both players play optimally,
# return 1 if the game is won by Mouse, 2 if the game is won by Cat, and 0 if the game is a draw.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: [[2,5],[3],[0,4,5],[1,4,5],[2,3],[0,2,3]]
# Output: 0
# Explanation:

#
# Note:
# - 3 <= graph.length <= 50
# - It is guaranteed that graph[1] is non-empty.
# - It is guaranteed that graph[2] contains a non-zero element.
