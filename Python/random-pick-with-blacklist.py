# Given a blacklist B containing unique integers from [0, N),
# write a function to return a uniform random integer from
# [0, N) which is NOT in B.
#
# Optimize it such that it minimizes the call to systemâ€™s Math.random().
#
# Note:
#
# 1 <= N <= 1000000000
# 0 <= B.length < min(100000, N)
# [0, N) does NOT include N. See interval notation.
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
# [[1,[]],[],[],[]]
# Output: [null,0,0,0]
# Example 2:
#
# Input:
# ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
# [[2,[]],[],[],[]]
# Output: [null,1,1,1]
# Example 3:
#
# Input:
# ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
# [[3,[1]],[],[],[]]
# Output: [null,0,0,2]
# Example 4:
#
# Input:
# ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
# [[4,[2]],[],[],[]]
# Output: [null,1,3,1]
# Explanation of Input Syntax:
#
# The input is two lists: the subroutines called and
# their arguments. Solution's constructor has two arguments,
# N and the blacklist B.
# pick has no arguments.
# Arguments are always wrapped with a list,
# even if there aren't any.
