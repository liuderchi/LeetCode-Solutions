# Time:  O(t * (logt + m * n)), t is the number of trees
# Space: O(t + m * n)

# You are asked to cut off trees in a forest for a golf event.
# The forest is represented as a non-negative 2D map, in this map:
#
# 0 represents the obstacle can't be reached.
# 1 represents the ground can be walked through.
# The place with number bigger than 1 represents a tree can be walked through,
# and this positive number represents the tree's height.
#
# You are asked to cut off all the trees in this forest in the order of tree's height -
# always cut off the tree with lowest height first. And after cutting, the original place
# has the tree will become a grass (value 1).
#
# You will start from the point (0, 0)
# and you should output the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees.
# If you can't cut off all the trees, output -1 in that situation.
#
# You are guaranteed that no two trees have the same height and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: 
# [
#  [1,2,3],
#  [0,0,4],
#  [7,6,5]
# ]
# Output: 6
# Example 2:
# Input: 
# [
#  [1,2,3],
#  [0,0,0],
#  [7,6,5]
# ]
# Output: -1
# Example 3:
# Input: 
# [
#  [2,3,4],
#  [0,0,5],
#  [8,7,6]
# ]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: You started from the point (0,0) and you can cut off the tree
# in (0,0) directly without walking.
# Hint: size of the given matrix will not exceed 50x50.
